# Bookstore Application
The bookstore application was incorporated with Java and its GUI was designed with JavaFX. 
State design patter was used for this application.
There are two types of users for this application: Owner and Customers.

The owner has a seperate login credential to access the app. The owner's username is 'admin' and the password is 'admin'.
The owner could use the bookstore application for the following:

-manage books, since they are able to add/remove the books from the table

-manage customers by adding new customers or removing customers and access the number of points they have

The registered customer's login credential is based on the credential the owner set up for them. 
After the customer logged in, their points and their status (Silver/Gold) will be displayed respectively.
If the customer has less than 1000 points, their status will be silver; while if the points is 1000 or above, their status will be gold
The customers could use the bookstore application for the following:
-Purchasing books either directly or redeeming points
